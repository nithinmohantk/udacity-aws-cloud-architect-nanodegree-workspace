Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1.) IAM policy is not following the principle of least privilege, allowing full access to resources.
2.) Loadbalancer is not configured to redirect Non-SSL(HTTP) requests to SSL(HTTPS)
3.) Application running on port 5000 can be easily accessible directly from public internet. 
4.) Serverside encryption and Logging is not enabled for S3 buckets
5.) IAM password policy - minimum length - Root account is not complaint 
6.) EC2 instance should be managed by AWS Systems Manager.



**Bonus** - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
--------------
-- IAM:
---- More Strictier/stringent password policy. Prevent reusing of previous passwords.
---- Update Root account password to meet the PAssword policy.
---- Update IAM policy to readonly 
-- Limit traffic on loadbalancer 

-- EC2 Intances:
---- Allow traffic only from Security Groups 
---- Disable unnecessary port access to the EC2 instance.
---- configure instance to be managed through AWS Systems Manager.

-- Storage:
---- S3 buckets- Enable logging
