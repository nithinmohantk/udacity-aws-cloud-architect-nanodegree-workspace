Brief Overview: 

RTO (Recovery Time Object)
- The Recovery Time Objective (RTO)[8][9] is the targeted duration of time and a service level within which a business process must be restored after a disaster (or disruption) in order to avoid unacceptable consequences associated with a break in business continuity.[Wikipedia]  

RPO (Recovery Point Object)
A Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is defined by business continuity planning. It is the maximum targeted period in which data (transactions) might be lost from an IT service due to a major incident.[10]

If RPO is measured in minutes (or even a few hours), then in practice, off-site mirrored backups must be continuously maintained; a daily off-site backup on tape will not suffice.[1]

Project Report: 


In the event of an AZ/DataCenter Outage
-------------------------------------

In a Multi-AZ, for a single AZ outage, the RTO is the time it takes to start up a new RDS instance.
- Minimum RTO will be around 2-3 minutes. 
Data loss is minimised as we failover from our primary instance to our secondary instance with no data lose.
- Minimum RPO will be 0.

In the event of aRegional Outage
----------------------------------

In the event of a single region outage, the RTO will be the time to promote the replica as the active. 
- Minimum RTO will be around 5 minutes to promote the replica. 
Read replica is asynchronous cross region, and it is near instantanious replication  
- Minimum RPO is 0.
