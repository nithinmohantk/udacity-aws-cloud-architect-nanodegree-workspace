## Introduction 
This repository contains my practical project works for **Udacity AWS Cloud Architect Nanodegree program**.  As part of working from home due to **COVID-19**, I decided to utilize my free time and do something to upskill myself with help of available free resources. With such interest I started with _[Udacity AWS Cloud Architect Nano Degree](https://www.udacity.com/course/aws-cloud-architect-nanodegree--nd063)_

## Installation 
 The samples and projects found in this repository are created using Visual Studio Code and Node.js/NPM/ExpressJS stack and it require certain global NPM components and project NPM components(project.json). 
  I used Windows 10 and 

### Install NodeJS
Install [NodeJS LTS version 10](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/).

- If you are in Windows, you can use the msi installers ([x86](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/node-v10.19.0-x86.msi) or [x64](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/node-v10.19.0-x64.msi)) in this link for the easiest way to set up NodeJS (notice that these direct links evolve over time, so check the latest v10 from the above directory).
- If you have NodeJS already installed, check that you have the correct version by using `node -v`. It should return version 10.19.0.

### Install Visual Studio Code IDE
You can use any code editor or IDE that supports client-side development to build your web part, such as:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  * I used Code
- [Atom](https://atom.io)
- [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm)
The steps and examples in this documentation use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but you can use any editor of your choice.
