## Introduction 
This repository contains my practical project works for **Udacity AWS Cloud Architect Nanodegree program**.  As part of working from home due to **COVID-19**, I decided to utilize my free time and do something to upskill myself with help of available free resources. With such interest I started with _[Udacity AWS Cloud Architect Nano Degree](https://www.udacity.com/course/aws-cloud-architect-nanodegree--nd063)_

## Useful Terraform Commands 

```terrafrom init```

```terraform plan```

```terraform apply```
